# 👷‍♂️ Form Architect
**Schema in. Form out.**

Form Architect is a type-safe, schema-driven dynamic form engine for Flutter.  
It allows developers to generate complete forms from JSON definitions, while keeping type safety, validation, and data binding fully integrated.

The goal is to make dynamic forms feel as safe and predictable as hand-written Flutter forms, while remaining flexible and extensible.
